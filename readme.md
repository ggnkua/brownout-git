brownout - A humble .elf to ST .prg binary converter

Written by George Nakos and Douglas Litte.

Uses the *elfio* library by Serge Lamikhov-Center to do the
heavy lifting that is ELF parsing. See elfio.hpp for its
license.

Everything apart from elfio library is released under
the WTFPL. Probably.
